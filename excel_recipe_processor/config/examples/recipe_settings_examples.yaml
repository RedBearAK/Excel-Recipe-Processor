parameter_details:
  description:
    type: string
    required: false
    description: "Human-readable description of what this recipe does"
    examples:
      - "Process customer data for monthly reporting"
      - "Quarterly sales analysis pipeline"
      - "Daily inventory reconciliation"
    usage: "Helps document recipe purpose for team collaboration"

  create_backup:
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false
    description: "Create backup copies of files before overwriting"
    examples: [true, false]
    safety_note: "Recommended for production workflows to prevent data loss"

  variables:
    type: dict
    required: false
    default: "empty dictionary"
    description: "Custom variables for use in file paths and processor configurations"
    structure: "Dictionary of key-value pairs where both key and value are strings"
    examples:
      - 'department: "sales"'
      - 'quarter: "Q4"'
      - 'threshold: "1000"'
    usage: "Variables can be referenced using {variable_name} syntax throughout the recipe"

  output_filename:
    type: string
    required: false
    deprecated: true
    description: "DEPRECATED - Use export_file processor step instead"
    deprecation_reason: "export_file processor provides more flexibility and control"
    replacement: "Use processor_type: export_file with output_file parameter"
    examples:
      - 'output_file: "results_{date}.xlsx"'

variable_substitution_notes:
  built_in_variables: "Available without definition: {date}, {timestamp}, {YYYY}, {MM}, {DD}, {YY}, {MMDD}"
  custom_variables: "Defined in settings.variables section and used with {variable_name} syntax"
  file_variables: "Automatically available: {input_filename}, {input_basename}, {recipe_filename}"
  precedence: "External variables (CLI) override recipe variables override built-in variables"

best_practices:
  organization: "Use descriptive variable names that clearly indicate their purpose"
  consistency: "Establish naming conventions for variables across recipes"
  documentation: "Always include description to explain recipe purpose"
  safety: "Use create_backup: true for production workflows"
  migration: "Replace deprecated output_filename with export_file processor steps"

common_use_cases:
  dynamic_naming: "Use variables for date-based file naming in automated workflows"
  environment_config: "Different variables for development vs production environments"
  batch_processing: "Use batch_id or similar variables for processing identification"
  multi_department: "Department-specific variables for shared recipe templates"
  reporting_periods: "Quarter, month, or year variables for periodic reporting"
